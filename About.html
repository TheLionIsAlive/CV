      <p><em><strong>Blooming Web Developer</strong></em></p>
      <p>In December of 2015, I graduated from Harding University with a B.A. in
        Journalism. Pursuing a degree in journalism tuned my eye to style and detail.
        The traditional journalism path, however, was not mine to take. As a new
        graduate, I found a few odd jobs to put the skills I'd learned to use, but
        the jobs that paid the bills was food service.</p>
      <p>Most recently, I've worked as a shift lead at Starbucks at a high development
        location in Tulsa, Oklahoma. However, eager to learn and eager to pursue
        creative work again that would pay the bills, I opted to saved up and quit my
        work at Starbucks to force myself into another path of learning and creativity,
        - one that this time would keep the bills paid.</p>
